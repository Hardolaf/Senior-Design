# User Interface Hardware
## Enclosure
The enclosure must be strong enough to withstand being stomped on. Guitar players usually actuate the switches by stomping on the pedal while playing.
A selection of enclosures is available at [build-your-own-clone](http://buildyourownclone.com/collections/enclosures-1)

## Connectors
### Audio
There must be some method of detecting when a cable is plugged in.
A visual guide to the mating of plugs and jacks can be followed [here](http://gaussmarkov.net/wordpress/parts/connectors/14-phone-jacks-and-plugs/)
#### Mono Jacks


#### Stereo Jacks
