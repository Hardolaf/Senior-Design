# User Interface Hardware
## Enclosure
The enclosure must be strong enough to withstand being stomped on. Guitar players usually actuate the switches by stomping on the pedal while playing.
A selection of enclosures is available at [build-your-own-clone](http://buildyourownclone.com/collections/enclosures-1)

## Connectors
### Audio
There must be some method of detecting when a cable is plugged in.
A visual guide to the mating of plugs and jacks can be followed [here](http://gaussmarkov.net/wordpress/parts/connectors/14-phone-jacks-and-plugs/)
#### Mono Jacks


#### Stereo Jacks


### Power


## Switches
A 3PDT switch and other switches are available at [BYOC](http://buildyourownclone.com/collections/switches-1)


## Rotary Input
Track Selection will use a rotary encoder of at least 4-bits with Gray Code ordering for direction determination. The exact number of bits past 4 will increase the resolution when the user turns the knob, but it also increases the number of digital inputs required.

Track playback volume will be controlled by a potentiometer. The center tap will be analog read by the DSP to digitally control output volume, regardless of mono vs. stereo.

Guitar play-through volume will be controlled by a potentiometer. The center tap will be analog read by DSP to digitally control output volume.
